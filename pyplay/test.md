# Taekwondo

Taekwondo is all about *kicking*. Not *punching*. **Taekwondo** means leg fist method. It teaches disipline



## My opinions about Taekwondo
- Is easy
- is fun 
- gives you lots of strength training
- kicking is more fun
- you will learn how to defend yourself soon

A good Taekwondo place is Mach Martial Arts

Here are some [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo) where can you learn [Takewondo](https://www.teamusa.org/usa-taekwondo/v2-getting-started-in-taekwondo/what-is-taekwondo).

Have fun practicing
